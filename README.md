## Course Description
This course offers a practical introduction to computer programming for engineering students using MATLAB. MATLAB is an easy and readable programming language and is an excellent choice for those learning programming for the first time. This course will cover various topics including programming fundamentals, matrix operations, file I/O, numerical methods, and data visualization. Students who successfully complete this course will gain a fundamental understanding of computer programming techniques and be able to operate, analyze, and visualize all types of data.  

This course incorporates two new learning tools in MATLAB to enhance programming-learning environment: [**Live Editor**](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) and [**MATLAB Grader**](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-grader.html). The *Live Editor* is a scripting platform to create, edit and run MATLAB scripts as well as add formatted text, images, and equations so that students can learn programing in more informative and interactive ways. A tutorial for each topic is provided in the Live Editor format. The programming lab and homework assignments will be designed using the MATLAB Grader. This tool allows students instant feedback on the correctness of their solutions through the pre-designed testers. Thus, students can be highly motivated and inspired to persevere with completing the assignments. You are expected to spend extra 6 hours a week studying class materials as well as working on the programming lab and homework assignments. 

This course includes lectures, tutorials, programming labs, and homework assignments:
 
* [**Lectures**](#course-outline) will cover the major topics, emphasizing and discussing the important points, and introduce programming examples in tutorials. 
* [**Tutorials**](#course-outline) are intended to review the lectures and prepare for programming lab and homework assignments.
* [**Programming-labs**](#programming-labs) provide an opportunity to practice writing and debugging programs with TA’s and instructor’s assistance.  
* [**Homework assignments**](#homework-assignments) are to provide additional practice for programming and evaluate your knowledge and programming skills

## Course Objectives
By the end of this course, students should be able to  
* Define your problems with programmable logic in MATLAB 
* Compose working, efficient, and readable code in various ways
* Debug your code to identify and fix programming errors

## Programming Labs 
There will be ten programming labs and nine lab assignments. The lab assignments are designed to help understand course materials as well as build programming capabilities. Students are supposed to complete all tasks and turn in their works **by the end of the lab (11:30 am)**. ***The instructor and two TAs will actively help complete the task within each lab session.*** Attendance in the labs is **not required**, but students who do not attend/are absent from the labs for any reason **must submit the lab assignment before the lab starts (9:30 am)**. 
The TA will check their submission status for absent students at **10:30 am** in each lab. **No late submission will be accepted for absent students.**     

|Lab|Topic|Starting Date|Lab Date|Due Date|
|:----|:-----|:-----|:----|:----|
|Lab 01|[**Getting Started with MATLAB**](lab/lab01)|May 6|May 9|**No submission**|

|Lab 11|**Numerical Technique**|July 20|July 25|July 25 at 12:30 am|

## Homework Assignments 
Students should be encouraged to work in groups through collaborative learning, but to submit their assignments individually. Students **must not share their solutions with other students**. The TA will run software to check your scripts to detect plagiarism. Please do not think that you may be able to deceive graders. Although you pass all the problems in MATLAB Grader, you will get a 0 grade if your solution is considered plagiarism and may be reported to Engineering Undergraduate Associate Dean as [**an academic offense**](#discipline). Each homework will be uploaded on Saturday night and must be submitted before the Monday class on the following week (ten days). After the due date, homework assignment online will be closed, and you are not able to submit your works. Again, **no late submission is accepted**, and any missed homework will be given a grade of 0. Thus, students who are not able to submit their assignment must inform the TA in advance with an email or at the office hour if you have a valid excuse. 

|HW|Topic|Starting date|Due date|
|:---|:-----|:----|:-----|

## Communication  
**All communication will be made through [this course website](https://github.com/chulminy/AE121)**, especially for this web page. The instructor will frequently make a note in the ["Announcement"](#announcement) section after updating the web page. Students can configure email notification for by ["watching"](https://help.github.com/articles/watching-and-unwatching-repositories/) this course website or use a version control system for tracking its changes (The link will be provided on every announcement to track the changes). Thus, **students are responsible for checking the website regularly** for any relevant course information or announcements. We will post an important announcement through LEARN, but LEARN will be only used for such announcement notification. Lecture slides, homework assignments, tutorials, and solutions are only accessible through this course website. 

In this course, the instructor, TAs, and the students are encouraged to engage in online discussions to create and facilitate a **collaborative learning experience**. Students are invited to ask questions and answer them and share their knowledge and resources. **Please direct your communications to the** [***Issues***](https://github.com/chulminy/AE121/issues) **board (tab) on this website.** However, if there is a good reason not to use the discussion forum (e.g., personal matters, a question that might reveal your solution of your report, etc.), please directly contact the TA via email (jpconnelly@edu.uwaterloo.ca) or use the office hours.

### Appeals
A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="/secretariat-general-counsel/node/100">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="/secretariat-general-counsel/node/97">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes he/she has a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="/secretariat-general-counsel/node/99">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>

### Note for students with disabilities 
<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/disability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>

### Turnitin.com
Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>

## Supplement

### Discussion forum instruction
- To post questions or comments, students should make their own Github account. **Students do not need to make their accounts using school emails if they already have accounts or they would have anonymity.**
- Please be respectful of your peers, instructor, and others in your posts and comments.
- Asking good questions is another way of learning by summarizing and explaining what you know and do not know. Thoughtful questions and answers will help all students in this class. Before posting a question, please ask yourself whether you are truly stuck (meaning that the answers cannot be readily found on the web) and your question are complete and legible. 
- In addition, please check if the same question was asked before.   
- Inappropriate posts and comments will be immediately deleted and closed without notice.
