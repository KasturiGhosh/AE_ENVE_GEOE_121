# Feedback Review for Quiz 1


## Review of the Grading 
I would first talk about the grading scheme in this course. 

|Component|Scores|
|:---|:-----|
|**Homework assignments**| 25 |
|**Quiz #1**| 10 |
|**Quiz #2**| 15 |
|**Quiz #3**| 20 |
|**Quiz #4**| 30 |
|**Online engagement**|extra up to 8*|
|**Total** |100| 


from [https://github.com/chulminy/AE_ENVE_GEOE_121#grading](https://github.com/chulminy/AE_ENVE_GEOE_121#grading)

I designed this course so that the **final class average ranges from 75 to 80**. Basically, you must receive a full mark from homework assignments and online engagement if you desire final grade that is above average. This is the bare minimum for students who take this course. Both your online engagement (8%) and assignment mark (25%) contribute to 33% of your final grade. This is not a small number. 

Let's assume that you receive 50 from all quizzes. That will become 37.5% of your overall grade, and your final course average becomes 70.5. Now letâ€™s consider a scenario where you receive an average 60 from your quizzes, then your final grade becomes 78. Although you received low scores on the quizzes, they do not drastically impact your final grade because you get the basic marks from the homework assignments and online engagement. If you receive over average 80 on quizzes, you will get over 90 in your final grade. I hope that you understand this grading mechanism. 

I understand that you want to receive perfect scores and high grades on your quizzes but this grading mechanism is meant to take into account that quizzes are typically harder to receive outstanding grades in. I would say, that the expected class averages for the quizzes in our course will not be more than 70, which is why participation and assignment grades hold such high contributions to your final grade. The quizzes that follow up will be harder than Quiz 1, so be sure to study effectively for your quizzes, watch review videos, and play an active role in help sessions and Learn discussions. 
I understand you are not happy about the difficulty of the quiz problems. However, it is not hard to pass the course or achieve a descent final grade if you submit all homework assignments on time and receive a full mark from online engagement considering that our quizzes do not hold as much contribution as they normally would. Also, in doing this, we can give an advantage to the students who steadily study this course. Your efforts will pay off! 

## Improvements for Future Quizzes
* Design problems with a clear description. 
* Design problems that will allow students to spend more time on writing scripts rather than understanding the questions.   
* Inform the students to submit their solutions earlier, and not at the last minutes (to avoid technical interruption)
* Provide two attempts of the submission instead of one. 
* Provide the number of stars to identify the difficulty of the problems so that students can make better time management. 


## Advice to the Students 
* Please read the course syllabus and quiz instruction carefully. Please read them before taking the quiz.
* You must read all announcements in LEARN. This is the only way we can communicate in an online environment. If they are unclear, please ask us! 
* To get prepared for the quizzes, you are able to solve all tutorial and homework assignments without looking at the solution.
* More than half of students haven't participated in any single TA help session. Last week, in the instructor session, there was no participation although it is for the students who are in Asia. I cannot appropriately evaluate the student's knowledge. There is no free lunch. You should make more effort in this course. 
* Understand coding techniques used in module/lecture/review videos. One thing is to copy, and another is to understand the script. Our example problems with given solutions are efficient and can help greatly improve your ability to read and write code if you learn to understand the way we write our code.

## Comments & Answers 

**I would answer some major feedback and address your concerns.**

|Feedback & Answer|
|:---|
|**Student:** I'm sure there are lots of students who didn't know to do that, even when they refreshed the page, it still said server unavailable, and they weren't able to submit until after the deadline because there were too many people on the server at once (which is again not their fault, but they will have lost a ton of marks because of it)."|
|**CM:** I apologize for the technical interruption. We did not expect such a crash when many students submit their solutions at the same time. I provided an extra 5 minutes to compensate for such interruption but it looks like it is not sufficient. If you think that the technical interruption highly impacts on your quiz and caused unfairness, please let us know. We will handle this issue under the policy of the technical interruption in the following instruction [Link](https://github.com/chulminy/AE_ENVE_GEOE_121/blob/master/annoucement/Quiz1_Description.md#technical-interruption). Depending on the circumstance, we might make an exception about only one-time claim policy. Please let us know as soon as you can.|
|**Student:** The questions need to be clearer|
| **CM:** This is a major comment that I received from many students. I admitted that some questions are unclear. Three TAs and I have reviewed the descriptions over and over. The wordings of the questions are similar to the ones in tutorials and homework assignments so we wrote these descriptions on the assumption that you are familiar with how we describe the problems. In another perspective, if you are familiar with the content covered in this course, you easily get the point of what we are asking. Nevertheless, we will pay more attention to our wording of the questions in the following quizzes.  
|**Student:** I would also appreciate if we had more homework / tutorial questions that mimic the quiz.|
|**CM:** Yes. To be honest, all problems are very similar to the ones in homework assignments and tutorials. If you can solve the problems in lectures, tutorials, and homework assignments without looking at the solutions, you can solve these questions within the time limit.
|**Student:** Need more time and difficult|
**CM:** Unfortunately, as mentioned in the beginning, we will not provide more time to solve the questions in the following quizzes. If the quiz hours increase, this means that the problems are more difficult. However, the problems in the following quizzes are designed so that the students can spend more time on writing the scripts rather than understanding the questions. We will try to shorten the problems and make them clearer so that the students do not waste their time to understand the questions. **NG:** We will try to make the following quiz questions easier to understand, but require you to write longer code.| 
|**Student:** One thing you could do is make the given code for each question copy and pasteable as the process of retyping everything into their own matlab programs is time consuming and leaves room for error. You are not testing our ability to copy your given code, so just for the quizzes if you could make it available in that way it would help.|
|**CM:** This is not true. You cannot copy the problem description but **can** copy and paste the given code. In the tutorial videos, I always copy and paste the given code to the MATLAB script window. Unfortunately, I do not know why you were not able to copy and paste the given code...|  
|**Student:** The only concern I had was with the ASCII chart on the last question - I misread it so it took longer to get my code right however if we use the ASCII chart again I would just include a link to the website like what was done in the tutorial/homework ! :)|
|**CM:** I would not make students avoid a web browser. I was thinking of attaching a link at the beginning but some ASCII tables include HEX or OCT codes as well so I decided to include the table as an image.  
|**Student:** The instant instructor feedback during the quiz was exceptionally helpful. I would be happy if this remained the same for future tests.|
|**CM:** Please ask questions during the quiz with a chat. It helps to save your time to understand and solve the questions. Also, it helps the other students. Unfortunately, less than 1/3 students are online during the test| 
|**Student:** My Webex was not showing the meeting, so I could not join the meeting before the test started.| 
|**CM:** I really do not understand this question. We have done more than 20 live help sessions with WebEX team over the last three weeks. In the quiz, we opened the same meeting session as usual. Please contact TAs in-person to figure out this issue.| 
|**Student:** The other big issue was that with so many students on at once I kept getting a message that the server was unavailable so the program wouldn't work to run the code or submit it. As well, when you refresh the page, you lose all your work on that question which is completely unfair because you are on a time limit. If I hadn't had to start a question completely over after I tried to submit it I would have been able to finish the quiz instead of running out of time. I think that this problem definitely needs to be fixed because it's really unfair to the students.| 
|**CM:** Again, I apologize for the technical interruption. I already mention this point at the beginning. However, I would want to say this. I do not agree on this point: *"program wouldn't work to run the code or submit it. As well, when you refresh the page, you lose all your work on that question which is completely unfair because you are on a time limit."* You should use the MATLAB script window to complete your code and run your script. The MATLAB Grader is the platform where you submit your work. That's why you only have one-time submission. Then, you do not have to worry about losing your code. As you watch my tutorial video, I never worked on my code in the MATLAB Grader because I encourage students to use the MATLAB script window. If you take more than a minute to "submit" your work, it is a big problem and students should report this technical interruption. 
|**Student:** I only failed 3 tests but they were in 3 different questions, so my mark would be drastically different based on how it is marked (a 40% vs an 83%)| 
|**CM:** The way we are marking your grade is different from the tests. So, do not worry about the test score that you got from the MATLAB grader. Next time, we will remove these weights to avoid potential confusion.|  
|**Student:** I found that the sequence question was very hard to do. I didnt know what was being asked and i dont think i would have known how to do it. Overall i genuinely enjoyed the quiz and found the other questions challenging yet well written and fair. thank you!|
|**CM:** If you see the solution, you will see it is not a very hard problem. You can solve them based on what you have learned in Module 02. Thank you for positive feedback|
|**Student:** The questions need to clearer. Itâ€™s hard to understand the questions most of the time, so you spend more time understanding the question than solving it. I think that it is also important to allow to put comments at the end and not during the quiz time! Thanks|
|**VF:** We do get occasional typos in our questions, but it shouldn't impact the way you interpret a question. If you are confused about something, the quickest way to not waste time on your quiz is so send either Noreen, professor Yuem or me, a message on WEBEX TEAMS. We will always be around to answer questions during your quiz.|
|**Student:** confused about duration of quiz|
|**VF:** We understand your confusion. We will try to be more clearer with our quiz duration next time. The end time on MATLAB grader is the official end time for your quiz just as an FYI to those who were wondering. However, we did send an email out to everyone 2 hours before the quiz to meet on WEBEX TEAMS because we would need to announce important updates about your quiz. Next time be sure to check your email and check Webex Teams for important updates regarding your quiz. We are sorry for the confusion.|
|**Student:** I tried writing the algorithms on paper so I can match what the question wants and Iâ€™m trying to write. However, this seemed to increase input and testing time for the solution, and I ended up rushing last three questions. For some questions, I hadnâ€™t realized the error until I saw the values inside matrix, because the dimensions were correct. I wonder if writing directly on the MATLAB will help saving time on the next quiz, so I can double-check my answers.|
|**VF:** It is highly recommended to write out your algorithms on the MATLAB editor as typing saves time and you can quickly debug your code after you hit run. For your next quiz, I highly recommend that you write into your MATLAB editor and copy and paste your solutions into MATLAB grader.|
|**Student:** If the level of difficulty of the questions could be identified with stars(like they are for modules and homework), I think that would help us plan our time better during the quiz.|
|**CM:** This is a very good comment. Yes, we will provide stars to the problems in the following quizzes.| 
|**Student:** The quiz was good, not too challenging but it covered a lot of content. My only wish was that there were two attempts instead of one. If only to correct small errors like a typo in variable name or a missing ' to transpose. With the time limit, it was stressful. Easy to miss these tiny details. |
|**CM:** Agree. We will change to two attempts in the future quizzes.| 
|**Student:** I feel some more tome could have been given to complete the quiz. Also It could have been made more clear that when you input your answers and move onto the next question without submitting, your answer is gone when you return. This miscommunication led me to having to re-input my code and submitting one answer a minute late, which as a result will not be counted as I surpassed the restricted time. Also, I think more quiz-like questions, specifically the sequences questions, for practice would have been very beneficial as I feel the homework didnâ€™t provide adequate or challenging enough questions to fully grasp this concept for the quiz.|
|**CM:** I apologize if I provided misinformation. I emphasize several times that you should work with MATLAB script window, not MATLAB grader. The grader should be only used for submitting your work because you cannot get any feedback from the grader. You can solve the sequence problem with a colon operator and dot multiplication. It does not require special logic to generate those sequences. | 
|**Student:** I personally thought that it was pretty long. Specifically there was a lot of problems to do in the given time frame.|
|**CM:** Understood. Yes, we will shorten the number of questions in the following quizzes.| 
|**Student:** Question one was beyond hard. It wasn't testing your coding skills but rather your ability in math. Aside from gr12, we haven't touched sequences yet in uni so I do not think it was a fair question.|
|**CM:** This is not true and is not a math problem. It is an element-wise multiplication problem. I will review quiz questions. **NG:** Compared to the previous MATLAB course I took, the course you are taking now focuses more on the coding side. In the MATLAB course I took, we were required to solve many mechanics problems. Since you are in engineering, you can't avoid math concepts almost in any course.
|**Student:** When I do matlab homework I take a lot more time, so it was very stressful for me to have the text notification of the countdown (although useful). It's also difficult to navigate both my matlabs and my latlab grader on one screen (at some point I couldn't see what I was typing). All in all it was a fair test, I was just under prepared. It was like the homework questions but I'm given around 4 times less the amount of time it normally takes me.|
|**CM:** You are used to do programming. It's a learning process if you are a first-time coder. Please do practice and solve the homework assignments and tutorial over and over without looking at the solution.| 
|**Student:** I think the questions were a fair difficulty, and I could have solved them. However, realistically I don't think the amount of time provided is sufficient to answer all of the questions while thinking them through and providing thorough comments to explain your code. This is also because most of the questions are of greater difficulty compared to the homework, tutorials, and lecture. I appreciate the possibility to receive partial marks.|
|**CM:** Yes. We will provide partial marks.| 
|**Student:** Additionally, I noticed that you mentioned that many students were not on the WebEx meeting and I think that was due to the fact that many people did not know where to access the meeting. In other classes, we are usually provided with an emailed link to the WebEx meeting, so that might be a good solution for next time!|
|**CM:** Yes. That's a good feedback. However, we would be honest here. We have provided more than 20 live sessions last three weeks. If the students attend at least one session, they know how to join or access the meeting.|
|**Student:** AI feel like the quiz needed more time, lets be honest... I was rushing between reading the question, putting it on matlab and doing it. I myself understand how to code, the problem comes when interpreting what someone else wants and trying to code it. That is much harder to do. I believe that more time should have been given, relative to me not making dumb mistakes from forgetting small stuff. The test was only hard when the time restriction makes someone code like that. In the real world, doing the exam like this would be easy if we had 2 hours. Because we waste time just to verify if our answer is right rather than actually doing the code itself.|
|**CM:** Don't get upset. We will give you the partial mark if your logic is correct. The score that you saw in the grader is not your final grade. Understood. We will make a clear problem description so that you do not waste your time on reading and understanding the problems themselves.|
|**Student:** Maybe in the future we could either extend the time limit or say that only on the first submission is it possible to receive 100% (but it must be submitted within the time limit) however after the time limit you may continue working on the questions or try again on ones you failed but only receive a maximum of 75% if you get them right. That way students are still showing their knowledge even if they aren't fast enough to do it in an hour and a half. I think this is a more effective way of testing because in the real world coding and debugging can take a long time. It requires thinking outside the box to try new solutions. However, if you set a strict quiz time and submission limit, students are only learning to memorize their old hmwk and trying to apply it to new questions instead of developing problem solving skills by exploring different ways to solve the question.|
|**CM:** This is a good approach and would incorporate it if it is an offline exam. Yes. We will increase the submission limit to two. Regarding this "That way students are still showing their knowledge even if they aren't fast enough to do it in an hour and a half. I think this is a more effective way of testing because in the real world coding and debugging can take a long time.", I do not think that the questions in Q1 require special or creative logic to solve. You will see such problems in the following quizzes and need more time to solve. Thank you for a good comment.|
|**Student:** I believe that the test also gave 20min for each question which is alright. But then we get to a-d for each question which means 3 mins each sub-question. With-in that time we need to 1 minute to read the question, 1-2 min to make the code, 1-2 min to check the solution is right and another 1 min to check if that is what the question is asking for. Hence, its like a min of 4 minutes per question instead of like the 3. And that can be very hectic. Like I understand how to code, but I kinda rushed at the end and made stupid mistakes like making an AND to OR.|
|**CM:** Yes. We will shorten the question and make them clearer in the following quizzes. We will give you partial marks.| 
|**Student:** (1) Please make the timings a little more clear, there was some end minute scramble about the extra 5 mins (2) If there are special instructions (like no loop statements), please mention them preferably at the top/in CAPS. I realised that after solving the entire question and didn't have any time to change (3) Please proofread questions (eg. Q2), it was hard to comprehend what was needed exactly which took up time(4) The simultaneous Webex is a big help! It's great to have the TAs and Professor online to ask for clarifications.|
|**CM:** You can solve the question based on what you have learned. If there is no special instruction, you can use any logic if you are aware of. Yes. We will make the problems clearer in the following quizzes|
