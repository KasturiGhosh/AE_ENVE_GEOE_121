# AE/ENVE/GEOE 121: Study Progress Survey (8th Week)

## Overview
Our teaching team really appreciate all valuable feedback and they will help designing the rest of this course. Overall, the feedback clearly divides into halves. For the students who are familiar with vectorized scripts and functions, they did not feel more difficult than the last two quizzes. If the students are not familiar with built-in function, operator, and functions, these problems were much more difficult. They couldn't even solve any single one. 

Please watch all videos that we posted. Our teaching team emphasized the importance of "function" in the tutorial and overview videos several times. It is true that the problems are not similar to the assignments like Quiz 2. However, all questions are not something that you are not able to solve within this time limit. 

Based on your feedback on Quiz 3, we will make the following changes in Quiz 4.
- There will be no change on the final quiz date. It will be on **Aug 11**.
- The length of the exam will be **150** minutes.
- You will submit your solutions **unlimited** times. Since we look at your solutions, passing the tests has no meaning in your grade. Some answers got full marks although they did not pass the tests. We evaluate your script!
- The number of problems will be 6 ~ 7. We will not give more questions although the time limit increases. 
- There will be one or two extra problems. 

**CM:** Some students complain that the example and assignments are useless for taking the quiz. However, that's not true. I made questions based on what I taught in lecture and tutorial. Please review all model solutions carefully. 

## Survey Results
### Q. How did you feel about your second MATLAB quiz 3? Note that the target overall average is 70.

**CM:** This is what level of difficulty our teaching team expects. Remember that more than the half of students does feel difficult on this quiz. Last year, among top 5 student, only one student had programming background. Programming background helps keeping up with this lecture but does not highly correlate your grade.  
  

### Q. I realized that your final quiz date conflict with the exams on the other course. Thus, our team would move the final quiz date to Friday (Aug. 14) in the same week. Do you agree with this schedule change? (Note that if the number of "no" is more than 20, I will not change the date).

**CM:** More than the half of student does not want to delay the final date. Let's keep the original schedule. Our teaching team does not put you under pressure. I think many people are on the same page with this student:
*Please do not change the date of the final. I already hate my life because of school. I can't do it anymore. not even another 5 days. please please please. I beg of you. I just need it to be over. I would do all my finals in one day if I could.*
