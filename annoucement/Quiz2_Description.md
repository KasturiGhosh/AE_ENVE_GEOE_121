# Quiz #2

## Major Changes from Quiz #1
*  There will be no live group call during the quiz and all announcements will be made using the group chat in WebEX team. 
*  Group 1 and 2 will take the quiz at the same time with different problems. 
*  No extra time will be provided.
*  You can submit **two times** instead of once. But, if you submit the solution two times, we will disregard your first submission and only grade your second submission.
*  We will deduce -3 if you submit the code with syntax or run-time errors. As you've experienced, you cannot pass any test if your script has any syntax or run-time errors. Please double-check that your script is working without error using the MATLAB editor.    

## General description
This quiz is to evaluate your understanding of key concepts covered **up to Module 5**. This is an individual online live exam. You must solve all problems on your own and not discuss them with other people. **We will make a general announcement through the WebEX Teams application (only chat) during the quiz.** You can ask questions anytime through the WebEX Teams application in person during the quiz. If you leave a message in a private chat window to your TAs or instructor, we will call you individually. To avoid asking one TA, students in Group 1 and 2 are encouraged to ask questions to Vlad and Noreen, respectively. All students can ask questions to the instructor but you might not get the response right away. 

During the quiz, you can only access (0) WebEx Teams (1) Course website, (2) MATLAB Grader, (3) MATLAB program in your computer, (4) Lecture/Tutorial videos, (5) Lecture slides, (6) MATLAB files that you have created while you study this course, and (7) Digital/Offline notes that you have made your own. Your digital note (in pdf or word) contains only texts and should not be a form of drag/drop website content. **Your internet browser must only be used to access the course website, MATLAB Grader, or Lecture/tutorial videos.**

## Quiz Schedule
Group 1:  **June 30** at 2:30 ~ 4:20 pm (EST).  
Group 2:  **June 30** at 2:30 ~ 4:20 pm (EST).  
Group 3:  July 01 at 7:00 ~ 8:50 am (EST) for the student who stay in Asia or Middle East.   

## Submission & Grading
For Quiz 2, you must solve all questions within **110 minutes**. Since the length of the quiz is also set to accommodate students who have technology challenges (e.g., slow internet connection, computer), no extra time will be provided. Note that if your solution is submitted after the designated due time, it will not be graded. Please submit your solutions on time. You can access and solve the problems in any order. As promised, the number of stars to identify the difficulty of the problems will be provided to help students time manage. You can submit your answer **only two times**. Once you make the second submission of your solution for each problem, you can still view the problem but the “submit” button is inactive (meaning that you cannot re-submit a problem that you already submitted twice). **We will only grade your second submission if you submit your solution two times.** Great care should be taken before you submit your solution. Thus, it is highly recommended that you run and check your solution in the MATLAB program installed on your computer. 

Please watch this video to understand how the quiz in the MATLAB Grader works:

A set of assessments (or tests) in the MATLAB Grader is designed in each problem for “preliminary” auto-grading but your solutions will be manually re-graded to provide partial marks. Please do not be discouraged when you see that you have not passed all your tests. You need to include a **concise comment** in your scripts using ‘%’ (comment symbol) to obtain better partial marks. If the programming logic is correct based on the judgment on your comments, higher partial marks will be obtained. You can use any MATLAB built-in function at your own risk unless otherwise noted. However, if you misuse or misapply built-in functions that have not been covered in lectures or tutorials, you will not get partial marks for using them. Please do not use a built-in functions that we have not covered in our course if you are unsure of its applications. The maximum score that you can get is 100. The score will contribute to the final grade with the corresponding weights outlined in the course website. 

## Technical interruption
In general, any technical interruption (e.g., disconnect or unstable internet, laptop malfunction, unexpected personal circumstances) is your responsibility. You need to ensure that you have stable internet connection, and a stable laptop/desktop before you start any of your online quizzes. The corresponding quiz will not be re-scheduled for the students that cannot re-take it. If you have any concerns with a potential risk of technical interruption, please inform us in advance. 

Fortunately, students can request relief of a missed quiz **only one time**. At this point, we cannot estimate how many students will face up such technical interruption during all four quizzes. If the number of students having technical interruptions during quizzes is a considerable amount, students will have the opportunity to take another special quiz a week in advance or after the final quiz. The special quiz will cover all modules regardless of the scope of the quiz that the students fail to take. If its numbers are small, the weights for the corresponding quiz will be transferred to the final quiz. This approach is based on that all students will have no technical interruption during the final quiz. We will make another special announcement for the final quiz later. 

## Policy for Cheating 
University policies have a zero-tolerance towards plagiarism and you will get a grade of zero if your solution is evidently plagiarized. You will be reported to Engineering Undergraduate Associate Dean for academic offense. Both copiers and copyees are guilty of cheating and will receive an equal penalty. If you and your colleague copy the solution from the web, it is still considered as cheating because searching the web is not allowed during the quiz. Moreover, You should not share the quiz problems with the students in other groups. This will be also considered as cheating. Students who cheat will receive a zero mark on online engagement, which means that they will not receive extra points. Again, sharing your solutions to your friend is stupid and you will pay for it. 

**Good luck!**
