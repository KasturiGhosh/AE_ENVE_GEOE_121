r1 = 12*(rand(1)*2-1); % a random real number between -12 and 12
r2 = 12*(rand(1)*2-1); % a random real number between -12 and 12
```

You need to write a script that creates a variable named:
(a) 's_a' which is copied from 'r1'. Please round-off the value in 's_a' towards nearest integer. 
(b) 's_b' which is copied from 'r1'. Please round-off the value in 's_b' towards negative infinity. 
(c) 's_c' which is copied from 'r2'. Please round-off the value in 's_c' towards positive infinity. 
(d) 'l_d'. If the 'r1' is larger than 'r2', assign 'true' to 'l_d'. Otherwise, assign 'false'. 
(e) 'l_e'. If the absolute value of 'r1' is larger than the absolute value of 'r2', assign 'true' to 'l_d'. Otherwise, assign 'false'.
