### Q1: What are ASCII values? <a name="Q1"></a> 
**Question:** I was curious where the numerical values come from that are assigned to each character? For example, why does char (97) return 'a'?

**Answer**: These numerical values for characters all come from the [ASCII Table](https://www.rapidtables.com/code/text/ascii-table.html). The ASCII table assigns numeric values to all kinds of characters, not just alphabetical characters. For example, char(64) returns '@'. It is just a standard to encode a character to a unique numeric value.

### Q2: How to use the colon operator to step up or down? <a name="Q2"></a> 
**Question:** In the colon operator it iterates through values in the form first:step:last, what does the step value stand for and how does it help create the vector? 

**Answer**: The "step" literally means a "jump". 

This "jump" could go up the numbers by any value you give it. Ex [1:3:10] would jump 3 spots from 1-10 printing out 1 4 7 10. 

It could also go down the numbers by giving it a "-" sign. Ex [10:-3:1] would jump 3 spots DOWN from 10-1 printing 10 7 4 1.
